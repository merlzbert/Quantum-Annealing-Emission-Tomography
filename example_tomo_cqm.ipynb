    "\n",
    "Tomographic reconstruction is a multidimensional inverse problem, where the problem is to estimate an object by only having projection views of the object. In Computed Tomography the projection views are captured by placing an x-ray source on one part of the object and a detector on the other side. The x-rays are attenuated by the matter and captured by the detector. In Single Photon Emission Computed Tomography (SPECT) the situation changes as the radiation source is in the patient, therefore collimators are used in front of the detectors to capture parallel gamma rays. One projection view can be thought of as an integration/summation of the rotated object. The simple projection process and corresponding matrix notation is showcased below:\n",
